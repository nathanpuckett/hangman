# Hangman

This is the classic game 'Hangman', written in Ruby for the command line.

This project demonstrates skills & techniques in the following:
- Creating class instances and using class methods
- Reading and parsing data from an external .txt file
- Using Catch / Throw exceptions
- Serializing a custom object to YAML & writing to an external .yaml file
- Unserializing YAML from an external file and using it to create a new custom object

Enjoy!
